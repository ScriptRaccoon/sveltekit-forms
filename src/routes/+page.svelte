<h1>Home</h1>

<p>
	This is a demonstration of how to leverage reactivity in SvelteKit apps without any
	client-side JavaScript. The state is encoded in the URL. And the JavaScript logic, if
	needed, is handled on the server inside of form actions.
</p>

<p>
	You can turn off JavaScript in your browser and all the examples will still work. The
	only difference is that the page will reload when you click a button or link.
</p>
