<h1>Home</h1>

<p>
	This project demonstrates how to achieve reactivity in SvelteKit applications without
	relying on client-side JavaScript. The application state is encoded in the URL, and
	any required JavaScript logic is executed on the server using form actions.
</p>

<p>
	You can disable JavaScript in your browser, and all the examples will still function.
	The only difference is that the page will reload whenever you click a button or link.
</p>

	The code is available on
	<a href="https://github.com/ScriptRaccoon/sveltekit-forms" target="_blank">
		GitHub</a
